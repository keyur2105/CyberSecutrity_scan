🚀 Agentic Cybersecurity Pipeline using LangGraph & LangChain.

Project Overview : 
This project is a rule-based agentic cybersecurity pipeline that autonomously scans a given target for security vulnerabilities using various tools like Nmap, Gobuster, FFUF,
and SQLmap. 
It is built using LangGraph, LangChain, Django, and Python, and integrates multiple security tools to provide comprehensive security scanning.

Features :
Automated Scanning Pipeline: Runs a series of security scans sequentially.
Dynamic Task Execution: Adds SQLMap dynamically based on open ports found by Nmap.
Asynchronous Execution: Uses Python's asyncio for non-blocking execution.
Django-based API: Provides a simple web interface for scanning.
Error Handling & Logging: Manages errors, logs outputs, and ensures robustness.

Installation & Setup :
Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:
Python 3.11+
Django
LangGraph & LangChain
Nmap, Gobuster, FFUF, SQLmap
Go (for Gobuster & FFUF)

Security Tools Used :
Nmap : Scans open ports & services
Gobuster : Directory brute-forcing
FFUF : Web fuzzing
SQLmap : SQL injection testing


How It Works this Project : 
  
Security_Pipeline.py
SecurityPipeline Class: Manages the scanning process using a task queue.
execute_task(): Runs each tool asynchronously.
run_pipeline(): Iterates through the task queue and executes scans dynamically.

Security_Scan.py
scanning(): Executes security tools using asyncio.create_subprocess_exec().
Error Handling: Handles missing tools, timeouts, and subprocess failures.

views.py
start_scanning(): Handles API requests and triggers async_scan().
async_scan(): Calls SecurityPipeline asynchronously and returns results.
